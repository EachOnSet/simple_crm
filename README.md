##Sierpinski Triangle
> Create a single page Web application with HTML5, CSS and Dart to manage contacts (names, emails and phones). For a model you may use [dartlero](https://github.com/dzenanr/dartlero) or create the model from scratch. Start with a list (or a table) of existing contacts that a user may update or remove. Create a form to add a new contact. Keep all contacts in main memory only. Thus, only a small number of contacts that you create by programming will be displayed initially.
